# automated-email-sender-
Ok so first things first im completely new to this and this is my first working script and you can change it to whatever you want it to say
1. make a burner email with two step verification and an app password in the security section
  this will be the email that will send the plan to you 
2. the next step is making the password and email you made work so go to your terminal on windows *i dont know how this works on linux* and type (setx EMAIL_ADDRESS "enteremail@email.com") and (setx EMAIL_PASSWORD "the app password that google made"
3. replace the emails in the script to the ones you want through notepad and you can replace other text in "" these change anything else and it will break this is meant for idiots after all
4. then just go into task scheduler, create a new file follow the steps and you should be good to go
